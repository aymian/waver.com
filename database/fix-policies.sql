-- FIX: Row Level Security Policies
-- ============================================

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;

-- Create correct policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"
  ON profiles FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow service role to bypass RLS (for triggers)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage all profiles"
  ON profiles
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
